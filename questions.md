#Questions:

1. If i want to make a pull request to repo of other user, do i need to clone it first?
2. In the classroom every studen has a repo, they need to make a pull to download all and create a new branch and stat to work on it and then just push ?
3. Really confused, should i do aways push from the branch master to the origin ?

Thank you in advance.
